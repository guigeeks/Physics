These are the examples from our presentation Physics in Android games. They will show how to get started with AndEngine and its physics extension.

The examples don't extend each other, which means there is quite a lot of duplicated code. The different AndEngine features we use are only explained in the first example where they appear.

This project contains JAR copies of AndEngine and the physics extension to make sure that everything just works. The latest versions can be found here:

AndEngine: http://code.google.com/p/andengine
Physics extension: http://code.google.com/p/andenginephysicsbox2dextension

Happy coding!
